<!--

##### (delete me or comment me out)

 
**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 2: January 30, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the freeCodeCamp projects, "Learn CSS Colors by Building a Set of Colored Markers."

**Thoughts**: CSS is already breaking my brain here. Using it to style empty containers chafes against my feeling that it should be for styling content, not styling blank space. I thought this was a thing of me not being smart or with-it enough to understand this use of CSS, but now I think it's a conceptual problem. From this conceptual problem flow all kinds of struggles with understanding properties and the arguments they take. This is definitely a place where a reference will come in handy. So I think I'll hunt down some writing about using CSS this way and a resource that will be a good reference.

### Day 1: January 29, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the freeCodeCamp projects, "Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App" and "Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu."

**Thoughts**: This is all familiar stuff, but I always appreciate the reminder to use semantic tags like \<section\> and the refresh of how forms work.
