# 100 Days Of Code - Log
<!--

##### (delete me or comment me out)

 
**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 5: February 9, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the freeCodeCamp certification project, "Learn Typography by Building a Nutrition Label."

**Thoughts**: This actually helped me understand justifying content using flexbox as much as it helped me understand typography.

### Day 4: February 6, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the freeCodeCamp certification project, "Learn CSS Flexbox by Building a Photo Gallery."

**Thoughts**: This is where my conceptual understanding of CSS starts to fall apart. I'm definitely going to dig deeper into this topic before I move on at freeCodeCamp.

### Day 4: February 3, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the freeCodeCamp certification project, "Learn the CSS Box Model by Building a Rothko Painting."

**Thoughts**: The basics of the box model were already quite familiar, but I really appreciated the reminder that we now have CSS properties (and have for a very long time) for things like making drop shadows, blurring, rounding corners, and rotating. Again, these are not new properties, but my internal sense of CSS is based on CSS 2.0 circa 2002, so these are useful reminders.

### Day 3: January 31, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the freeCodeCamp certification project, "Learn CSS Colors by Building a Set of Colored Markers."

**Thoughts**: This was fun to do and after doing some reading, I've realized that for my purposes, I don't actually need to know how to draw with CSS unless I decide to try and make some wacky layouts with shapes or something. In which case, I'll review. But in the meantime, CSS is for styling HTML that structures content, just as I feel it should be. This project is not hard but I definitely had to use references sometimes. Which is fine! But slows things down a bit. For this project, the use of a checkbox gave me the idea to make this a Mystery Shack feedback form so I could use Mabel's rigged "Do you like me?" form.

### Day 2: January 30, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the freeCodeCamp projects, "Learn CSS Colors by Building a Set of Colored Markers."

**Thoughts**: CSS is already breaking my brain here. Using it to style empty containers chafes against my feeling that it should be for styling content, not styling blank space. I thought this was a thing of me not being smart or with-it enough to understand this use of CSS, but now I think it's a conceptual problem. From this conceptual problem flow all kinds of struggles with understanding properties and the arguments they take. This is definitely a place where a reference will come in handy. So I think I'll hunt down some writing about using CSS this way and a resource that will be a good reference.

### Day 1: January 29, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the freeCodeCamp projects, "Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App" and "Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu."

**Thoughts**: This is all familiar stuff, but I always appreciate the reminder to use semantic tags like \<section\> and the refresh of how forms work.
